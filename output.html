      <td>Then new arrivals\r<br>deranged the line, and Jordan and I were pushed suddenly inside.\r<br>\r<br>Myrtle Wilson’s body, wrapped in a blanket, and then in another\r<br>blanket, as though she suffered from a chill in the hot night, lay on\r<br>a worktable by the wall, and Tom, with his back to us, was bending\r<br>over it, motionless. Next to him stood a motorcycle policeman taking\r<br>down names with much sweat and correction in a little book. At first I\r<br>couldn’t find the source of the high, groaning words that echoed\r<br>clamorously through the bare garage—then I saw Wilson standing on the\r<br>raised threshold of his office, swaying back and forth and holding to\r<br>the doorposts with both hands. Some man was talking to him in a low\r<br>voice and attempting, from time to time, to lay a hand on his\r<br>shoulder, but Wilson neither heard nor saw. His eyes would drop slowly\r<br>from the swinging light to the laden table by the wall, and then jerk\r<br>back to the light again, and he gave out incessantly his high,\r<br>horrible call:\r<br>\r<br>“Oh, my Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od! Oh, Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od!”\r<br>\r<br>Presently Tom lifted his head with a jerk and, after staring around\r<br>the garage with glazed eyes, addressed a mumbled incoherent remark to\r<br>the policeman.\r<br>\r<br>“M-a-v—” the policeman was saying, “—o—”\r<br>\r<br>“No, r—” corrected the man, “M-a-v-r-o—”\r<br>\r<br>“Listen to me!” muttered Tom fiercely.\r<br>\r<br>“r—” said the policeman, “o—”\r<br>\r<br>“g—”\r<br>\r<br>“g—” He looked up as Tom’s broad hand fell sharply on his shoulder.\r<br>“What you want, fella?”\r<br>\r<br>“What happened?—that’s what I want to know.”\r<br>\r<br>“Auto hit her. Ins’antly killed.”\r<br>\r<br>“Instantly killed,” repeated Tom, staring.\r<br>\r<br>“She ran out ina road. Son-of-a-bitch didn’t even stopus car.”\r<br>\r<br>“There was two cars,” said Michaelis, “one comin’, one goin’, see?”\r<br>\r<br>“Going where?” asked the policeman keenly.\r<br>\r<br>“One goin’ each way.</td>

Well, she”—his hand rose toward the blankets but\r<br>stopped halfway and fell to his side—“she ran out there an’ the one\r<br>comin’ from N’York knock right into her, goin’ thirty or forty miles\r<br>an hour.”\r<br>\r<br>“What’s the name of this place here?” demanded the officer.\r<br>\r<br>“Hasn’t got any name.”\r<br>\r<br>A pale well-dressed negro stepped near.\r<br>\r<br>“It was a yellow car,” he said, “big yellow car. New.”\r<br>\r<br>“See the accident?” asked the policeman.\r<br>\r<br>“No, but the car passed me down the road, going faster’n forty. Going\r<br>fifty, sixty.”\r<br>\r<br>“Come here and let’s have your name. Look out now. I want to get his\r<br>name.”\r<br>\r<br>Some words of this conversation must have reached Wilson, swaying in\r<br>the office door, for suddenly a new theme found voice among his\r<br>grasping cries:\r<br>\r<br>“You don’t have to tell me what kind of car it was! I know what kind\r<br>of car it was!”\r<br>\r<br>Watching Tom, I saw the wad of muscle back of his shoulder tighten\r<br>under his coat. He walked quickly over to Wilson and, standing in\r<br>front of him, seized him firmly by the upper arms.\r<br>\r<br>“You’ve got to pull yourself together,” he said with soothing\r<br>gruffness.</td>

I was bringing you that coupé we’ve been talking\r<br>about. That yellow car I was driving this afternoon wasn’t mine—do you\r<br>hear? I haven’t seen it all afternoon.”\r<br>\r<br>Only the negro and I were near enough to hear what he said, but the\r<br>policeman caught something in the tone and looked over with truculent\r<br>eyes.\r<br>\r<br>“What’s all that?” he demanded.\r<br>\r<br>“I’m a friend of his.” Tom turned his head but kept his hands firm on\r<br>Wilson’s body. “He says he knows the car that did it … It was a yellow\r<br>car.”\r<br>\r<br>Some dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspiciously at Tom.\r<br>\r<br>“And what colour’s your car?”\r<br>\r<br>“It’s a blue car, a coupé.”\r<br>\r<br>“We’ve come straight from New York,” I said.\r<br>\r<br>Someone who had been driving a little behind us confirmed this, and\r<br>the policeman turned away.\r<br>\r<br>“Now, if you’ll let me have that name again correct—”\r<br>\r<br>Picking up Wilson like a doll, Tom carried him into the office, set\r<br>him down in a chair, and came back.</td>
