Any inappropriate or harmful outputs from the model could have serious consequences, including spreading misinformation, causing offense, or even causing harm.\n\nSecondly, during the pretraining phase, the models are trained on large amounts of data from the internet, which can include harmful or biased content. If not properly managed, these biases could be learned and reproduced by the model.\n\nFinally, during the fine-tuning phase, the models are further trained on specific tasks, and it's important to ensure that they do not produce harmful outputs even when they are generating creative or novel responses.\n\nTherefore, the authors have incorporated safety measures in both the pretraining and fine-tuning stages of Llama 2's development.

Instruction tuning involves fine-tuning LLMs on numerous datasets to obtain zero-shot performance on unseen tasks. Prompts used for instruction tuning can be created by humans or by LLMs themselves, and follow-up instructions can be used to refine initial generations to make them more useful, engaging, and unbiased. Another approach related to instruction tuning is chain-of-thought prompting, in which models are prompted to explain their reasoning when given a complex problem, in order to increase the likelihood that their final answer is correct.\n\nRLHF is a strategy that enables significant improvements in the performance of LLMs. In this method, models are fine-tuned based on feedback from human users, thus iteratively aligning the models\u2019 responses more closely with human expectations and preferences. A combination of instruction fine-tuning and RLHF can help fix issues with factuality, toxicity, and helpfulness that cannot be remedied by simply scaling up LLMs. \n\nThese techniques align with human preferences and expectations by making the models' responses more accurate, engaging, unbiased, and helpful. They also help in fixing issues with factuality and toxicity in the models' responses.",

(2021) have underscored various hazards associated with Large Language Models (LLMs). These hazards include bias, toxicity, private data leakage, and the potential for malicious uses. These challenges significantly impact the use and development of LLMs. For instance, bias and toxicity can lead to the generation of harmful or offensive content, which can negatively affect users and the reputation of the models. Private data leakage poses a risk to user privacy, while the potential for malicious uses can lead to misuse of the technology for harmful purposes. These challenges necessitate the development of strategies and techniques to mitigate these risks and ensure the safe and responsible use of LLMs.",

(2022b), involves partially automating the process of fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs). This is achieved by replacing the human-labeled fine-tuning data with the model\u2019s own self-critiques and revisions, and by replacing human raters with a model when ranking model outputs in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). This process contributes to the performance and usability of models like Llama 2 by aligning the models\u2019 responses more closely with human expectations and preferences, and by helping to fix issues with factuality, toxicity, and helpfulness that cannot be remedied by simply scaling up LLMs."
